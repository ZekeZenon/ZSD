<p>ZSD, derived from FreeBSD</p>

<p>ZSD
Zenon System Distribution.
Based on the FreeBSD kernel relicensed with the GPL, as with the GNU userland.</p>

<p>ZSD is intended to be high performance, low maintaince, FreeBSD distro. The initial installation will require the automated compiliation of the entirety of the OS for the machine it is residing in currently. This will allow for faster speed than typical precompilied distributions and operating systems. Using the tried and true FreeBSD kernel, we intend to make patches to send up the chain to further enhance FreeBSD in a positive manor.  Installation will also include a point in where the user will have to decide how his starting operating system will be formed. One can choose to have many upon many packages to make his system utilitarian, or one can have a stripped down and fast system to use in situations like gaming, programming, or other situations that require less bloat, less size, and/or more speed.
Many of the system tools will receive updates to allow for a GUI based program with fewer chances of doing unintended operations. This will also allow for easier use and maintence. Many features from GNU/Linux distros will be incorporated to make a better system for our users.
We will also be changing the behavior of many well known FreeBSD tendencies to match more of GNU/Linux. This structure according our developers are better for management, and usability.</p>
